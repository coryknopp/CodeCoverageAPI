# CodeCoverageAPI

To execute coverage API, run `sh build.sh`. This will run Cobertura to get coverage data and then run coverage API.

Alternatively, run `sh run.sh` to build the coverage API without running Cobertura first. This will only work if `cobertura.ser` already exists.

To run all coverage API JUnit tests, run `sh test.sh`.
